# Introduction

The Nexway API allows for an almost unlimited set of possibilities for interfacing the Nexway platform with your favorite CMS, web app, android app or any other third party software.

Getting started with the Nexway API is easy. We have a great getting started guide to help you through the basics. Tutorials that can help you through more advanced issues and the API Reference for learning exactly what our API can do.

# Authentication

Nexway implements 2-legged OAuth 1.0a protocol as its authentication method against our API. For a detailed technical explanation of the RFC and how to implement inside your app, see http://oauth.net/core/1.0/.

Any developer can request a consumer key and a consumer secret to start using our API's.

The consumer secret should be kept secret.
